Rheometer data Knappe, Manga and LeFraint (https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EA000876) for the hemipelagic sediment and salton sea sediment

Each sample has two excel spread sheets. One for the static tests and one for the dynamic tests. 

For the static tests: We apply increasing shear stress (tau) or torque on the rheometer, measure resulting deformation or strain.
For the dynamic tests: We apply shear strain rate and the shear stress (tau) or torque required to maintain the strain rate measured 

Each test is at a different volumentric concentration, which is listed above the test data.
